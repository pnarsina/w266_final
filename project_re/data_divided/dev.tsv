63612	0	a	- History of SUB_B pulmonary embolism SUB_E on OBJ_B Coumadin OBJ_E - Adrenal insufficiency, on chronic steroid replacement therapy.
63615	0	a	On the floor patient finished the course of OBJ_B antibiotics OBJ_E for SUB_B HAP SUB_E, continued diuresis, and standing nebs.
63620	8	a	History of Present Illness: (History mostly obtained from ED and patient nodding or shaking head as CPAP mask makes talking difficult).
63622	8	a	Patient reports feeling well yesterday and rather acute development of this this AM.
63629	8	a	Therefore, he was started on peripheral dopamine before having a femoral line placed at which point he was transitioned to norepinephrine for presumed pneumosepsis and hypotension (lactate was 3.8).
63634	8	a	He was asking for CPAP to be removed.
63656	8	a	Imaging: CXR: [**5-19**] A left-sided pacer demonstrates leads in the right atrium, right ventricle and coronary sinus.
63675	8	a	Persistent mild pulmonary [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] engorgement.
63681	8	a	Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
63686	8	a	Multiple etiologies were considered to explain his hypoxic respiratory failure.
63689	8	a	Unfortunately, all sputum cultures were contaminated.
63692	8	a	Further, patient was anticoagulated making PE less likely.
63693	8	a	With history of COPD steroid taper was started as well as standing nebs.
63698	8	a	This somnolence and diminished respiratory drive was thought to be secondary to small increase in the patient's gabapentin dose which he was taking for post herpetic neuralgias.
63703	8	a	His O2 was removed to see if his respiratory drive was depressed, but he desatted down to 70% and needed to have the oxygen replaced.
63710	8	a	4) Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive in the context of receiving nitroglycerin but remained hypotensive once this medication was stopped.
63714	8	a	Eventually, blood pressures stabilized and anti hypertensive agents were restarted.
63716	8	a	During his stay he was diuresed with IV lasix and then converted to 20mg PO lasix at the time of discharge.
63717	8	a	Patient was continued on QOD digoxin and while his beta blocker and [**Last Name (un) **] were initially held these were restarted prior to discharge.
63718	8	a	6) Stage IV CKD: On admission Creatinine was not markedly elevated from baseline.
63720	8	a	Nephrotoxins were avoided when possible.
63728	8	a	Once blood pressures stabilized patient was transitioned to home hydrocortisone regimen.
63733	8	a	HCT will be followed as an outpatient and EPO injections will be continued.
63735	8	a	No vision changes or eye involvement.
63743	8	a	13) GI Bleed: On [**5-29**], patient developed dark melenotic stool in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR.
63746	8	a	GI deferred endoscopy given the patient's stability and poor respiratory status given concern the patient would reguire intubation for the procedure.
63749	8	a	14) Non Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia: Throughout the hospitalization patient had NSVT.

75726	8	a	Course complicated by anuric renal failure requiring dialysis.
75732	8	a	She received thiamine.
75739	8	a	She received Haldol and Ativan, which sedated her profoundly for several days.
75743	8	a	Her head CT was unchanged.
75751	8	a	Pt was transferred to the MICU on [**6-2**] for respiratory compromise (see below).
75752	8	a	-Upon arriving at the floor on [**6-5**] the patient was AOx3, but with residual confusion, impulse control issues, and aggitation.
75755	8	a	Psych was consulted and attempted to help control these outbursts without using benzodiazepems.
75757	8	a	She was transferred to the MICU for low O2 saturation, where she was diuresed for congestive heart failure/volume overload.
75761	8	a	This combination had a calming effect and the patient was significantly less agitated without being over-sedated, thought to be back to her baseline mental status.
75765	8	a	Patient has history of COPD, CHF, and pulmonary hypertension per outside notes.
75767	8	a	No clear pneumonia.

75793	8	a	CTA was negative for PE.
75796	8	a	In conjunction with the renal team, the patient required almost daily HD or ultrafiltration to draw off fluid.
75799	8	a	The patient was witnessed several times eating high salty foods, and being non-compliant with the fluid restriction which complicated attempts to manage her volume status.
75802	8	a	Outside hospital records revealed creatinine of 4.0 in [**Month (only) 958**] [**2166**].
75807	8	a	Received aggressive hemodialysis sessions.
75808	8	a	There was concern that tunneled dialysis line infected, but as she was not rigoring and did not ever develop fever or hypotension except when on dialysis, believed that filter on hemodialysis machine may have caused adverse reaction.
75810	8	a	Management of the patient's volume status was complicated by dietary noncompliance and aggitation.
75813	8	a	Adding neurontin to her anxiety regimen helped calm her and she became more compliant with our management strategy and was less likely to take off her oxygen support.
75830	8	a	5) GI: On admission, apparent UGI bleeding.
